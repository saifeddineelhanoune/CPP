    Static Typing

    n C++, static typing means that the data type of a variable is determined at compile time, 
    before the program is executed. 
    This means that a variable can be used only with data of a specific type, 
    and the compiler ensures that the operations performed with the variable are 
    compatible with its type.

    C++ is a statically typed language, 
    which means that it uses static typing 
    to determine data types and perform type checking during compile time.
    This helps with ensuring type safety and can prevent certain types of errors 
    from occurring during the execution of the program.
